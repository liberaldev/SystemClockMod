	<!--<ChangeLog>
 * Changed the way locale is loaded, no longer requiring i18n Everyware. Based on code by zakuro9715, which is licensed under the GPLv3, the license for this mod is also GPLv3. This change changes very little for the average user.
 * You can set the clock size in the preferences, and you can choose to show it down to the second. The default is to not show seconds, so if you want it to show seconds like it used to, go to the System Clock section in Settings and change the setting. 
 * The logic for fetching the system clock is now handled in the Csharp code, not the UI, and the UI simply outputs the value. There may be performance improvements. There may be performance improvements.
